### Classification of CIFAR-10 dataset via deep convalutional neural network

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images:

We train a neuron network, containing 2 convolutional and 2 dense layers, to classify the images. Our best accuracy on the test dataset is ???. The loss and accuracy curves are presented below:

*TODO: to use pre-train networks, to use GPU*
